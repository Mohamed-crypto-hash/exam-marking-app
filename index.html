      <h2>Description</h2>
      <p>
        The app uses Optical Character Recognition (OCR) to extract text from scanned or photographed exam papers, 
        making it compatible with handwritten and printed content. After extracting the answers, **AI algorithms** 
        automatically mark them based on a customizable marking scheme. Teachers can review results, provide 
        instant feedback, and track student performance through detailed reports. This app reduces grading time, 
        ensures accuracy, and helps educators focus on teaching.
